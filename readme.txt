README.TXT
most programmers use a readme.txt file to explain what the project is about
it can be as simple as a few lines or paragraph to a very long complex file
This is the new added line for this change to be reflected in the Github repository we still need to do a git add, git commit, and git push.updated
You have updated readme file in branch task .Now we need to get the changes in master too, What do we do ? we pull from branch task while we are at master.
